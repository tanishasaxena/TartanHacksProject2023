Breakout is a pseudo command line based game set in a strangely liminal yet oddly familiar building where the player interacts with items and their surroundings in disruptive ways as they break out from each stage to ultimately escape the confines of this space. 

## Game Commands 
- **look/inspect/examine/info \<item>**: gives details about an item
- **use/open/interact \<item>**: use/open/interact with an item
- **grab/take \<item>**: put an item into inventory, will be removed from inventory once used
- **forward/backward/left/right**: move forward/backward/left/right

## Running 
Download the files and import into Processing 3 or Processing 4 to run the game.
